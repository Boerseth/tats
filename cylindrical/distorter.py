#   - The area to the sides of the side lines filled in red (255, 0, 0), including the pixel

#
# So, given (i, j)_new, how to find (x, y)_old?
#
# We can identify all the points on the cylindrical object using a cylindrical coordinate system.
# This associates with each point some angle  theta  , which can be used as proportional to  i .
# The pixel locations of the old image, however, are defined by the viewing angle  phi  as seen
# from the camera, where the object takes up an angle  2alpha . So, we need a map
#
#      i        ->   theta   ->   phi   ->   x
#  (x-coord                                 (x-coord
#  of new image)                            of old image)
#
# The first arrow is the easiest, the last slightly more tricky, but the very trickiest part is the
# geometry of the middle one,  theta->phi . There may be a more elegant way to write it, but I
# worked out the formula
#         ___________________________________________________
#    z = âˆš 1 + sin(alpha)^2 - 2 sin(alpha) sin(theta + alpha)
#
#    phi = alpha - arccos((1 + z^2 - sin(alpha)^2)/2z)
#
# The left and right lines show the shape of the cylindrical object, and vertical lines in our new
# image should follow paths similar to these. The start- and end- points of these horizontal lines
# lie on the top- and bottom-lines that we have found, and are completely decided by the angle  phi,
# as a fraction of the angle  alpha .
# 
# We then need only to know where  j  maps onto one of the side-lines (I use the left side-line for
# the left half of the picture, and vv.), and then how to move and stretch the side-curves when we
# move them to start and stop at the start- and end-points we found. This is done in the simplest
# possible way I could think of, completely proportionally, and assumes that the start- and end are
# not in the same  x- position. My method could be improved by instead using the angle  theta  to
# decide how things morph.
#
# This, in the end, will result in a vector with non-integer value, and I just round them down.
# Another improvement would be to instead take a weighted average of the four pixel values around
# the final point, but that to me seems like overkill.
